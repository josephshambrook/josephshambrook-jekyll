And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing - not once, ever.</p><p>I don’t say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility - for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman.</p><p>But with Trump, it’s a fact. He doesn’t even seem to understand what a joke is - his idea of a joke is a crass comment, an illiterate insult, a casual act of cruelty.</p><p>Trump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers.</p><p>And scarily, he doesn’t just talk in crude, witless insults - he actually thinks in them. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness.</p><p>There is never any under-layer of irony, complexity, nuance or depth. It’s all surface.</p><p>Some Americans might see this as refreshingly upfront.</p><p>Well, we don’t. We see it as having no inner world, no soul.</p><p>And in Britain we traditionally side with David, not Goliath. All our heroes are plucky underdogs: Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Oliver Twist.</p><p>Trump is neither plucky, nor an underdog. He is the exact opposite of that.</p><p>He’s not even a spoiled rich-boy, or a greedy fat-cat.</p><p>He’s more a fat white slug. A Jabba the Hutt of privilege.</p><p>And worse, he is that most unforgivable of all things to the British: a bully.</p><p>That is, except when he is among bullies; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling sidekick instead.</p><p>There are unspoken rules to this stuff - the Queensberry rules of basic decency - and he breaks them all. He punches downwards - which a gentleman should, would, could never do - and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless - and he kicks them when they are down.</p><p>So the fact that a significant minority - perhaps a third - of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think 'Yeah, he seems like my kind of guy’ is a matter of some confusion and no little distress to British people, given that:</p><ol> <li>Americans are supposed to be nicer than us, and mostly are.</li><li>You don't need a particularly keen eye for detail to spot a few flaws in the man.</li></ol> <p>This last point is what especially confuses and dismays British people, and many other people too; his faults seem pretty bloody hard to miss.</p><p>After all, it’s impossible to read a single tweet, or hear him speak a sentence or two, without staring deep into the abyss. He turns being artless into an art form; he is a Picasso of pettiness; a Shakespeare of shit. His faults are fractal: even his flaws have flaws, and so on ad infinitum.</p><p>God knows there have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid.</p><p>He makes Nixon look trustworthy and George W look smart.</p><p>In fact, if Frankenstein decided to make a monster assembled entirely from human flaws - he would make a Trump.</p><p>And a remorseful Doctor Frankenstein would clutch out big clumps of hair and scream in anguish:</p><p>'My God… what… have… I… created?’</p><p>If being a twat was a TV show, Trump would be the box set.</p></main><footer> <div class="content"> <p>I didn't write this; <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-many-British-people-not-like-Donald-Trump">a chap called Nate White did</a>.</p><p>Page coded by Joseph Shambrook using some super simple HTML and CSS.</p></div></footer><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-18052288-3"></script> <script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}gtag('js', new Date()); gtag('config', 'UA-18052288-3'); </script></body></html>
