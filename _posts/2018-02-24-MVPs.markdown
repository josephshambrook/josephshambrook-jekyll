Plan: write about how I've learnt about implementing MVPs

Usual trait of mine, getting bogged down by scope of project, taking forever to integrate numerous ideas, end up abandoning in favour of new thought.

MVP is agile policy I've learnt at AND Digital. Always have something that _works_, but isn't necessarily finished. At least then, project is done in a way rather than feeling like it's impossible to finish.

For this site, I haven't done the CSS properly. Got a whole backlog of things to do, but at least the site is _out_ and being used.
