I've wanted to write this article for a while now - around 5 years. Getting hold of advice for starting out with developing websites may not be as difficult as it was, but I still feel I would've appreciated articles from developers in the business who can still remember what it was like.

First, a little background. I started in web development in 2010 after being in a job for 18 months that pushed my intellect in absolutely no way. I managed to get my first job in 2011 - a part time job developing very basic HTML for eBay descriptions (I think they were desperate to find some sort of work for me, as I was very junior). I then got my first full time web developer job at a brand new startup called WeSwap. They gave me a shot at the time that literally kick-started my new career, and I'll always value them for that.
