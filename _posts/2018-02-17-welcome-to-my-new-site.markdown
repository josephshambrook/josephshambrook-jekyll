Hello.

It's taken me around 2 years to get around to updating my site. It got to a point where my old one displayed outdated information of where I was working and I couldn't update it. Plus, my hosting needed renewing, and I didn't see why I should buy Â£30 to host my useless site for another year. So, here we are.

First off, I never could decide how I wanted to host it. In the end, I was inspired by the brilliant Front End dev Harry Roberts and his [CSS Wizardry] website, which uses [Jekyll]. That way, the site is fully open sourced, hosted for free by GitHub, and rather easy to install and use. 

I went with a fairly bold design this time, and used CSS Grid and CSS Custom Properties for the first time in a production site. That's rather exciting for me; I'd been practicing my CSS Grid for a while over on [CodePen], and Custom Properties are awesome. I haven't taken full advantage of either of those on here yet, but this site is a WIP anyway.

I've got some ideas for what I can write about, so I'll get on with those soon. For now, a lot of my time is spent on my work at [AND Digital], and it's pretty awesome. Tried Web VR for the first time the other day, for instance.

Signing off to carry on. Onwards and upwards.
